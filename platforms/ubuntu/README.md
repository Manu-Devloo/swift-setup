# Ubuntu 21.10<br>Pop!_OS 21.10

[**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com) was the first Linux distribution to support Swift. [**Pop!_OS**](https://pop.system76.com) is derived from Ubuntu, so the following instructions apply to Pop!_OS as well.

Open the **Terminal** application and run the following commands:

```
sudo apt install -y curl
curl -s https://archive.swiftlang.xyz/install.sh | sudo bash
```

At the prompt, enter **1** to select the latest stable release of Swift.

Next, install Swift:

```
sudo apt install swiftlang
```

Finally, verify that you can run the following command:

```
swift --version
```
