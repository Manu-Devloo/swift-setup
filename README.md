# Swift Setup

This repository describes how you can set up a development environment for the [Swift programming language](https://swift.org).

Our goal is to support the adoption of Swift as a general purpose cross-platform programming language in education. To that end, we provide student-friendly instructions for various platforms, editors, and IDEs that support Swift.

## Platforms

- [CentOS 8](platforms/centos/README.md)

- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](platforms/centos/README.md)
